## Project Description 
This project aims to model a two-player auction-based monopoly board game to find the best strategy of accumulating the most wealth by the end of the game. In this game scenario, every unbought property immediately goes to auction when a player lands on it. The strategy would be how much a player chooses to bid on the property. We hope to find a consistent winning strategy that takes into consideration player's current wealth, opponent's current wealth, price, rent, number of properties in the same neighborhood already owned, and so on.

For the sake of simplicity, we will NOT implement ability to:
- Upgrade properties (i.e. build houses and hotels),
- Chance/community chest cards,
- Going to jail, and
- Auction off owned property when rent cannot be paid (so player automatically loses if they cannot pay rent).

## Methodology
### Game Logic Implementation
There are three main Python objects in this simulation. The `Board` class will follow available data on the classic Board and keep track of property information (price, tax, neighborhood). The `Player` class has the ability to roll the die, keep track of owned property and wealth, specify a player's valuation function, and so on. The `Game` object simulates a game by having `Board` and `Player` interact, by simulating auctions when applicable and when game-ending criterion is met.

As a recap, these are the rules and key game elements of Monopoly :
1. **Board Layout**: 
   - The board consists of 40 squares, including properties, utilities, railroads, and special spaces (like "Go," "Free Parking," and "Income Tax").
   - Properties are divided into neighborhoods or color groups.

2. **Properties**: 
   - When a player lands on an unowned property, it immeddiate goes to auction. 
   - If a property is owned by another player, rent must be paid based on the property's value.
   
3. **Wealth**: 
   - Each player starts with $1,500. Players can accumulate wealth through rent collection and passing Go (get $200).
   - Going bankrupt (i.e. cannot pay rent) eliminates a player from the game.
   - Having less wealth when all properties are bought also ends the game.

4. **Rolling the Dice**:
   - Players take turns rolling two dice to move around the board.
   - The outcome of dice rolls determines movement and whether the player lands on an unowned property, owned property, or other squares.

Other game rules can be found at [Hasbro's official rule book](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf).

### Auction Theory
A player's auction strategy will depend on:
- Expected value from the property (rent, how frequently that square gets landed on, what in the neighborhood is already owned)
- Price of property in relation to current wealth 
- Opponent's auction strategy

We will find the best strategy for the four most common auction designs, described as:
- **English auctions**: players continue to make higher bids until they are no longer willing to pay higher than the last price
- **Dutch auctions**: a high price is initially set and decreases until a player is willing to pay the current price
- **Blind auctions**: players simultaneously bid a price without knowing the opponent's price, and the higher bid wins
- **Vickery auctions**: the highest price bidder wins, but only has to pay the second-highest price
- **Random auctions**: randomly select a bidder that is able to buy the base cost

### Data Collection
The Python objects created above will, by design, track the players' actions and game state throughout each game. The inputs will include player decisions, the outcomes of dice rolls, and auction strategies.

### Feature Extraction
The key features to track for each turn of the game include:
- Current auction design
- Players' wealth
- Players' risk-aversion
- Number of properties owned
- Rent paid
- Auction results (winning bids and price)
- Final results of who won each game
- Neighborhood completeness (number of completed neighborhoods)
- Number of time passing Go
- Total rounds
- Reason for game ending (bankruptcy or all properties bought)

We will run these simulations *n* times, for different auction designs and combinationo of player types, until we have sufficient data for analysis.

## Potential Data Inconsistencies 
Some errors and edge cases that may occur with our data collection may be:
- A player going bankrupt too early in the game before establishing any bidding strategy
    - **Fix**: In the data cleaning stage, accept a valid  game only if each player gets over 20 turns (change this depending on how much sufficient data we have)
- Random outcomes of dice rolls putting too much noise in the data, a.k.a. sometimes players are just "lucky"
    - **Fix**: Run a sufficient number of games and plot dice roll outcomes to ensure it is the expected distribution (2d6 Gaussian distribution)

## Visualizations and Modeling

 We will first visualize where on the board players are landing on the most to determine which neighborhoods are best to buy and incorporate that into the Player's strategy. 

After collecting the data, we will apply machine learning models to identify patterns and predict optimal strategies. Visualizations can include:
 - wealth over time
 - auction outcomes
 - the effect of different bidding strategies on game results
 

## Future Steps
### Modeling 
We will explore various algorithms, such as decision trees or reinforcement learning, to predict the best moves based on game states. According to similar previous studies, 


## Testing
We will validate the effectiveness of our model by testing it on unseen Monopoly runs. Metrics for success will include winning percentage, average wealth by the end of the game, and the impact of each factor (e.g., property ownership, rent payments, and auction bids) on the game outcome.

## Project Update:
Originally we thought that player landings (what square the player lands on the board) would be evenly distributed between the total number of tiles on the board. The simulations showed otherwise. Square 25 and 31 were the most landed on squares.

English auctions, which are the most common auction type, were also the more successful auction type when running simulations. The wealth history for both players increased gradually, and the simulation went on for over 500 rounds. We also saw that there is a clear distinction between the winner and loser in the game by seeing the wealth history and the amount of property owned by both players.

The auction alternative that we also have implemented is a random auction, where when a player lands on a property, a random number generator selects which player can buy the property. If the player cannot afford the property, the property goes to the other player.

During the simulations, we could clearly see that the data is more chaotic in terms of wealth history. The simulation went for only ~40 rounds (as opposed to the 500+ in englih auctions) and because of the low number of rounds, the players did not have enough time to recover from spending too much money on properties.

In the english auction, the game ended because every property was bought by the players, while in the random auction, the game ended because one of the players went bankrupt.

## Next Steps:
- Explore results of multiple runs with different player combinations.
- Implement who-goes-first as a feature.
- Apple machine learning models on this feature to see if we accurately predict future game results.
- Build other auction types if time permits.
